    title: "About Me"
    image: "/images/thibaud.jpg"
    content: |-
      I'm a **software engineer** with more than **13 years of experience** making **games**, **backend services** and **cloud infrastructures**.
      I have worked in different industries: FinTech, Robotics, Datascience and Games. 

      My journey into multiplayer games started very young. My earliest gaming memories were with my older cousin, while playing [Skitchin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skitchin%27) and [Bio-Hazard Battle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bio-Hazard_Battle) in split-screen on his Sega MegaDrive.

      Later, in High School, all of my friends where PC gamers: it was a real LAN parties paradise! We played the *hell* out of the Diablos, Counter-Strike, DoTA, â€¦ to cite only a few!
      At the same time, we also discovered MMORPG with The 4Th Coming and started building our first online community. People I have met there became some of my closest friends. 

      That's why I love making multiplayer games:  
      **I want to create deep and engaging experiences, where communities can thrive and friends can be made.**
